# DevWave E-commerce API

A full-stack e-commerce backend built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB. This project provides a robust RESTful API for managing products, categories, users, carts, orders, feedback, authentication, and more. It is designed for modern e-commerce applications and includes features like JWT authentication, role-based authorization, Swagger API docs, and file uploads.

- **Product Management**: CRUD operations, filtering, and search
- **Category Management**: CRUD for product categories
- **Cart System**: Add, update, remove, and clear cart items
- **Order Management**: Place orders, view order history, admin order controls
- **Feedback System**: Product reviews and ratings
- **File Uploads**: Integrated with Uploadthing
- **Swagger API Documentation**: Interactive docs at `/api-docs`
- **Environment-based Config**: `.env.development` and `.env.production` support

## Tech Stack
